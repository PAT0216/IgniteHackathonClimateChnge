In today's day and age, a lot of people produce high amounts of carbon emmissions through various activities,
the most common one being the usage of electricity.

To calculate the amount of emissions from an entity, we'll find out the carbon footprint of that entity, the entity being an individual, event, organisation, etc.
A Carbon Footprint is the amount of CO2 along with other emissions released by an entity, expressed in its carbon dioxide equivalent.

Now we'll use the concept of this same carbon footprint in our prototype to calculate the carbon footprint of an entity by finding out the amount of use of a particular energy source.
Then we'll find out the how to offset the given amount of carbon footprint, by finding out how many trees the entity should plant, thus supporting the planet and slowing down global warming.


Now, there are various electricity generating sources throughout the world, segregated into renewable and non-renewable energy sources.
Non-renewable sources have a much higher carbon footprint, that renewable energy sources(generally). Thus countries using more non-renewable energy sources will have a higher carbon footprint and vice versa.

In this prototype, we have data on energy produced by various countries in its various forms(coal, natural gas, oil, etc). 	

The Sources for the data is mentioned  in the Sources folder.
The working of the site is quite simple, the default values suggest the default energy sources for the given country, eg: India gets 75% of its electricity produced from coal, which emits 820 grams of CO2 for every KWh of energy produced.
Other sources can also be modified according to the users need.
Then the value of CO2 emissions is calculated using a simple formula, based on energy consumption used continuously in an year.
Then the amount of trees needed to offset your emissions is calculated by dividing the Carbon Footprint by 21 based on the data from the source.
In this way, we have created a simple prototype to help in climate conservation and preventing global warming.
